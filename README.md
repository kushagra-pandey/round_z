The website is now live at forkaia.herokuapp.com (I'm working on configuring the domain name).

To run the website, you can either go to the above link or:

1) Download this repo

2) Create a virtual environment and run pip freeze -r "requirements.txt"

3) Go to the root directory and run flask run

If you want to modify the website, DM me at kushagp@berkeley.edu and I can add you as a heroku contributor to the website. After that, all you would need to do is login to heroku via your command line, make your changes, and run the following:

1) git add *

2) git commit -m "message"

3) git push heroku master
