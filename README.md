The website is now live at forkaia.herokuapp.com (I'm working on configuring the domain name).

To run the website, you can either go to the above link or:

1) Download this repo

2) Create a virtual environment and run pip freeze -r "requirements.txt"

3) Go to the root directory and run flask run
